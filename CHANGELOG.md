# Changelog

## 0.17.0-dev.17

- Fixed the missing `DecodeTarget` import in the static demo and moved the target model into its own pipeline module.
- Added viewport/DPR-aware physical decode targets with 8-pixel alignment, aspect-preserving fit, and a four-megapixel safety budget.
- Replaced the fixed 1024-pixel Animated WebP target; native and Flutter codec paths now share the same target derived from the actual image viewport.
- Fixed Flutter codec presentation by giving the image tight expanded constraints and matching `cacheWidth`/`cacheHeight` instead of rendering at intrinsic size.
- Changed native preview playback to prepare the next frame while the current frame is visible and subtract preparation time from the encoded duration, removing decode time from the animation timeline.
- Added pause-safe pending-frame/completion scheduling, physical-target tests, and frame-pacing regression tests.

## 0.16.0-dev.16

- Bundled the three deterministic Animated WebP fixtures as real Flutter app
  assets and added a checked JSON catalog.
- Replaced the automatic static-reader launch with a demo home that exposes the
  100-page chapter, bundled Animated WebP catalog, and local WebP import.
- Added system file selection through `file_selector` 1.0.3, selected to retain
  the workspace Dart 3.6 compatibility floor.
- Added an in-app Animated WebP player that can compare the native source/cursor
  pipeline with Flutter's codec and automatically falls back when the native
  runtime is unavailable or incorrectly linked.
- Added `PixelFrame`, raw RGBA-to-Flutter image presentation, alpha
  premultiplication, finite/infinite loop playback, pause/resume, and native
  runtime provenance reporting.
- Added fixture synchronization, asset/native-byte equality gates, app entry
  tests, catalog tests, and local-import route tests.

## 0.15.0-dev.15

- Replaced the external per-ABI `ZIC_ANDROID_WEBP_ROOT` contract with a pinned
  upstream libwebp source checkout.
- Added `native/libwebp.lock` for version 1.6.0 and exact commit verification
  against the official WebM repository.
- Added host and Android CMake source builders with isolated `.deps` build and
  install trees, Android NDK ABI configuration, and a static-by-default APK link.
- Updated Android native packaging to link only source-generated libraries and
  package upstream `COPYING`, `PATENTS`, and source provenance.
- Added source-built host smoke/Rust scripts and CI coverage for all Android
  ABIs; distribution `libwebp-dev` packages are no longer used by CI.
- Made native inclusion explicit with `ZIC_ANDROID_NATIVE`; split APK builds
  include the source-built media core by default and can opt out for UI-only CI.
- Bumped the native ABI to v5 and exposed linked libwebp decoder/demux versions
  so Dart can reject an incorrectly linked runtime instead of trusting filenames.

## 0.14.0-dev.14

- Replaced the nullable `FrameCursor.decodeNext()` result with explicit
  `CursorStep.frame`, `CursorStep.needMoreData`, and `CursorStep.end` states.
- Added `CursorBinding`, so `DecodeSession` receives frame and optional loop
  capabilities with static types and no `is LoopCursor` runtime branch.
- Updated native and fake cursor factories to return typed bindings; non-loop
  EOF now enters `DecodeState.ended` instead of being confused with incomplete
  input.
- Added media/session regressions for explicit cursor states and cancellation
  disposal.
- Hardened libwebp verification by checking every byte prefix of all animation
  fixtures and adding a bytewise native cursor test.
- Added Android Rust/libwebp per-ABI packaging scripts for arm64-v8a,
  armeabi-v7a, and x86_64, with shared/static dependency layouts.

## 0.13.0-dev.13

- Added native Animated WebP frame-count, play-count, metadata-complete, cycle,
  and rewind ABI functions.
- Added explicit infinite and finite animation loop semantics. Rewind is only
  accepted after end-of-stream and finite play counts are enforced natively.
- Added `AnimationInfo` and optional `LoopCursor` media contracts.
- Updated `DecodeSession` to rewind only after held frames are consumed and to
  enter an explicit `ended` state after a finite animation is exhausted.
- Added animation-loop telemetry, a finite-loop WebP fixture, C smoke coverage,
  Rust ownership/rewind tests, and Dart session-level loop tests.

## 0.12.0-dev.12

- Replaced the native WebP cursor placeholder with real incremental Animated
  WebP decoding through libwebp partial demux.
- Decode only complete frame fragments; incomplete prefixes return
  `needMoreData` without advancing cursor state.
- Added target-size RGBA composition with WebP blend and dispose handling,
  immutable frame handles, duration propagation, and one-pass end detection.
- Added a deterministic two-frame Animated WebP fixture and Rust tests for
  complete decode, partial-prefix waiting, frame bytes, and end-of-stream.
- Added system/custom libwebp link configuration, C dependency smoke checks,
  CI installation, and repository gates.

## 0.11.0-dev.11

- Made `ReaderBinding` require explicit `Coordinator` and
  `PlaybackCoordinator` dependencies instead of deriving playback capability
  from a demand coordinator at runtime.
- Added ABI v3 native cursor create/free/decode contracts with epoch checks and
  shared source ownership.
- Added retained native frame handles with immutable metadata/data access and
  independent retain/release lifetimes.
- Added Dart `NativeCursorFactory`, `NativeCursor`, and `NativeFrame` wrappers.
- Added `SourceStatus.failed` and source-lock failure handling.
- Added reader-binding interface separation, ABI enum/version, source/cursor
  ownership, and frame-retain regression tests.

## 0.10.0-dev.10

- Replaced the stale `ReadingDirection.leftToRight` test value with `ltr`.
- Added `ReaderBinding` to drive demand reconciliation and viewport playback
  from the same reader observation, and connected the demo app to the binding.
- Added decoded-frame and renderer-output byte budgets with current-page
  reserves and low-priority non-current trimming.
- Added output byte accounting, claim-safe frame/output trimming, and frame
  budget telemetry in `LiveCoordinator`.
- Added reader-binding and frame-budget integration tests plus regression gates.

## 0.9.0-dev.9

- Removed invalid trailing commas from native source enum index expressions.
- Added split-per-ABI Android APK builds through `tool/build_android.sh`.
- Switched CI and full toolchain checks from fat APK to split APK output.
- Added viewport idle/dominant/overlap/continuous phase resolution.
- Added playback gating and coordinator integration for viewport freeze/resume.
- Added regression tests for discrete overlap, target dominance, continuous
  scrolling, and playback-gate state transitions.

## 0.8.0-dev.8

- Fixed duplicate upload work caused by source-ready and download-complete wake-ups.
- Counted renderer-owned ready output toward the decode watermark.
- Added non-cancelling lane follow-up work with per-key coalescing.
- Added explicit frame advancement; source progress alone no longer advances playback.
- Added a playback timer whose duration starts after actual present, with freeze/resume.
- Added regressions for duplicate upload, prepared depth, lane follow-up, and playback timing.

## 0.7.0-dev.7

- Imported `EncodedSource` in the frame cursor contract.
- Fixed `Artifact.readPrefix()` closing its random-access file before the
  asynchronous read completed.
- Added an immediate prefix-read/file-close regression test.
- Added renderer-owned output frame and frame uploader contracts.
- Added upload sessions and registry with upload and present claims.
- Deferred output disposal while a present claim remains active.
- Rejected and disposed stale upload results.
- Connected successful decode work to upload-demand wake-up.
- Added upload state, uploaded-frame, and presented-frame telemetry.

## 0.6.0-dev.6

- Fixed restored sniff prefixes being stored as unmodifiable lists.
- Changed artifacts to open partial writers lazily and serialize writes.
- Removed idle file handles from startup recovery and cache scanning.
- Added source-ready/source-disabled telemetry and early decode wake-up.
- Added frame/cursor contracts, frame holder claims, decode sessions, and a
  decode registry keyed by `DecodeId` and source epoch.
- Made coordinator idle detection stable across work submitted by other lanes.
- Added regression coverage for the reported session failures and decode flow.
- Copied queued byte chunks at ownership boundaries and isolated
  source-listener failures.
- Disposed frames decoded after cancellation or epoch supersession.
- Fixed coordinator upload dispatch and cancellation of detached active
  downloads during dispose.

## 0.5.0-dev.5

- Fixed the missing `DownloadSession` import in `LiveCoordinator`.
- Moved `RetryPolicy` duration validation out of const evaluation.
- Added the pure Dart media contracts, source pool, and format-aware ingress.

- Added explicit Flutter and Dart package test runners.
- Added cache limits, LRU planning, safe trim/clear, and released-byte reports.
- Added bounded retry/backoff for demanded failed downloads.
- Added decode, upload, and maintenance lane shells.
- Added Rust incremental byte-source ABI and Dart FFI wrapper.

## 0.3.0-dev.3

- Renamed the reserved `library` package to `catalog`.
- Added cache index, scanner, startup recovery, network lane, and live download
  coordination.
